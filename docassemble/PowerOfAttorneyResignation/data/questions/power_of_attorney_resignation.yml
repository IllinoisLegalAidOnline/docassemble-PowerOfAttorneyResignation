  Instructions
subquestion: |
  You can use this program if you want to resign as an agent for a power of attorney.
  
  To use this program you will need to know:

  * The date the power of attorney was created, and
  * The date you plan to resign as an agent for the power of attorney.

  After you download your letter, you will need to sign it with a notary public. After the letter is notarized, you can mail it to your **{principal}** and anyone else who should know that you resigned.
    
  Set aside 5 to 10 minutes to finish this program. You can log in and save your work to return to later.
